## Question 1

**Q**: What is the greedy choice property?

**A**: It means a globally optimal solution can be reached by making a locally optimal choice at each step.

## Question 2

**Q**: Why does the greedy algorithm fail for the 0/1 Knapsack problem?

**A**: Because taking the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio doesn’t always lead to the best combination of items.

## Question 3

**Q**: What is a real-life example of a greedy algorithm?

**A**: Dijkstra’s algorithm, which finds the shortest path from a source node by always expanding the nearest unvisited node.

##Question 4

**Q**: What is the main difference between greedy algorithms and dynamic programming?

**A**: Greedy algorithms make one-shot decisions without revisiting choices, while dynamic programming explores and stores all subproblem results.

## Question 5

**Q**: How does the Greedy algorithm work?

**A**: Greedy algorithms build up a solution step-by-step, always choosing the option that looks best at the moment.
